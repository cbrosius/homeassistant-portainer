Monitor and control Portainer from Home Assistant.

Features:
* Get Portainer-Endpoints and create a device for each endpoint
* Get Containers per Endpoint and create a device for each container
    * provide buttons to control containers
    * provide sensors to monitor container status
    * provide sensors to monitor container details
    * set the 'Connected via' Attribute in the devices to handle dependencies correct
* Get Stacks per Endpoint and create a device for each stack
    * provide buttons to control stacks
    * provide sensors to monitor stack status
    * provide sensors to monitor stack details


# Features
## Endpoints
For each endpoint configured in Portainer, a dedicated Home Assistant device is created. This device represents the Portainer endpoint itself and acts as a parent for all container devices running on it.

The endpoint device provides key details and sensors, including:
*   **Details**: Endpoint name, Docker version, and a direct link to its configuration URL in Portainer.
*   **Sensors**:
    *   Reachability status
    *   Counts for unhealthy and stopped containers
    *   Totals for images, volumes, and stacks

## Containers
For each container managed by a Portainer endpoint, a corresponding Home Assistant device is created. This device is automatically linked to its parent endpoint device, making it easy to see which containers belong to which environment.

The container device provides a central place to monitor its status and details. Key information and controls include:

*   **State Sensor**: The primary sensor shows the container's current state (e.g., `running`, `stopped`, `exited`). For running containers with a health check, the state will be more descriptive (e.g., `running (healthy)`).
*   **Detail Sensors**: Additional sensors are created to provide more granular information, such as:
    *   IP Address
    *   Published Ports
    *   Image ID
    *   Start Time and Creation Date
    *   Compose Stack and Service names (if applicable)
    *   Health Status (if enabled)
    *   Restart Policy (if enabled)
*   **Controls**: You can control the container directly from Home Assistant using the `portainer.perform_container_action` service. This allows you to `start`, `stop`, `restart`, or `kill` one or more containers, which is perfect for automations and scripts.

## Stacks
For each stack defined in a Portainer endpoint, a corresponding Home Assistant device is created. This device is linked to its parent endpoint device.

The stack device provides sensors to monitor its status and composition. Key information includes:
*   **State Sensor**: The primary sensor shows the stack's current state (e.g., `active`, `inactive`, `limited`).
*   **Detail Sensors**:
    *   Container Count: The number of containers running as part of this stack.
*   **Controls**: You can manage the stack directly from Home Assistant using the `portainer.perform_stack_action` service. This allows you to `start`, `stop` the entire stack.

# Services
The Portainer integration exposes services to allow direct control over your containers and stacks from Home Assistant automations and scripts.

## `portainer.perform_container_action`
This service allows you to perform actions like starting, stopping, restarting, or killing one or more containers managed by your Portainer instance.

### Service Data Attributes:
*   **`action`** (Required): The action to perform.
    *   Possible values: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `kill`
*   **`container_devices`** (Required): A list of Home Assistant device IDs corresponding to the containers you wish to control.

### Example Usage:
To use this service, you'll need the Home Assistant `device_id` of the container(s) you want to control. You can find this by navigating to the device page in Home Assistant (Settings -> Devices & Services -> Devices, then select your container device) or by inspecting the device in Developer Tools -> States.

Here's an example of how to stop a specific container using this service in a Home Assistant automation or script:

```yaml
service: portainer.perform_container_action
data:
  action: stop
  container_devices:
    - device_id: a0e2c2f2e7b1a4d5c6f7e8d9c0b1a2c3 # Replace with your container's device_id
```

As an alternative, you can use the UI to perform this action.

## `portainer.perform_stack_action`
This service allows you to perform actions on an entire stack, such as starting or stopping all containers within it.

### Service Data Attributes:
*   **`action`** (Required): The action to perform.
    *   Possible values: `start`, `stop`
*   **`stack_devices`** (Required): A list of Home Assistant device IDs corresponding to the stacks you wish to control.

### Example Usage:
To use this service, you'll need the Home Assistant `device_id` of the stack(s) you want to control. You can find this by navigating to the device page in Home Assistant (Settings -> Devices & Services -> Devices, then select your stack device) or by inspecting the device in Developer Tools -> States.

Here's an example of how to stop a specific stack using this service in a Home Assistant automation or script:

```yaml
service: portainer.perform_stack_action
data:
  action: stop
  stack_devices:
    - device_id: b1f3d3a3f8c2b5e6d7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4 # Replace with your stack's device_id
```

As an alternative, you can use the UI to perform this action.

# Install integration
This integration is available via the Home Assistant Community Store ([HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)).

Since this integration is not in the default HACS repository, you must add it as a custom repository.

1.  **Navigate to HACS**: In Home Assistant, go to `HACS` > `Integrations`.
2.  **Add Custom Repository**: Click the three-dots menu in the top-right corner and select `Custom repositories`.
3.  **Add the Repository URL**:
    *   In the `Repository` field, paste this GitHub repository's URL: `https://github.com/cbrosius/homeassistant-portainer`
    *   In the `Category` dropdown, select `Integration`.
    *   Click `Add`.
4.  **Install the Integration**: The "Portainer" integration will now appear in your HACS integrations list. Click `Install` and proceed with the installation.
5.  **Restart Home Assistant**: After the installation is complete, you must restart Home Assistant for the integration to be loaded.

After restarting, you can proceed with getting your access token and setting up the integration.

## Get portainer access token
1. Login into your portainer instance
2. Click you username at top right and select "My Account"
3. Under "Access tokens", click "Add access token"
4. Enter name for your access token (can be anything, for example "homeassistant")
5. Copy displayed access token for use in integration setup

## Setup integration
Setup this integration for your Portainer in Home Assistant via `Configuration -> Integrations -> Add -> Portainer`.
You can add this integration several times for different portainer instances.

* "Name of the integration" - Friendly name for this Portainer instance
* "Host" - Use hostname or IP and port (example: portainer.domain.tld or 192.168.0.2:9000)
* "Access token" - Use access token from previous step
* "Use SSL" - Connect to portainer using SSL
* "Verify SSL certificate" - Validate SSL certificate (must be trusted certificate)

## Configuration
When setup is done, it is possilbe to cunfigure custom attibutes for each entry via `Configuration -> Integrations -> Portainer -> Configure`.

List of supported custom attibutes:

* "Health check" - Checks if the container is running correctly by executing a defined command.
* "Restart policy" - Defines how and when the container restarts after stopping.
